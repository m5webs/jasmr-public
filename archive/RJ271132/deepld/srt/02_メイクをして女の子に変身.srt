1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,300
Please sit on the chair over here

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,350
 Are you a little bit nervous?

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,570
 After all, it's your first time doing makeup

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,300
 It's okay, please relax

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,520
 So here we go

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,500
Let's start with the lotion

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,670
 Your skin looks great

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,500
 Do you usually take care of it?

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,270
 Obviously not

10
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,820
 I'm jealous that your skin is still so good

11
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,450
 What kind of makeup would you like to try?

12
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:01,920
 Something more flamboyant, or something more lovely

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,220
 If it's you

14
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,120
 It would be more of a cute type

15
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,819
 Okay, then I'll give you a cute makeup

16
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,319
 So then I'll start applying the foundation

17
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:24,170
 Spread it with your fingers

18
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,720
 so that it fits into the skin

19
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,700
 Is your heart beating faster?

20
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,800
 It's okay

21
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,500
 Because you're already a good-looking person

22
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,150
 It's going to be perfect for you

23
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,770
 I'm going to start applying it to the corners of my eyes

24
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:49,020
 Please close your eyes

25
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,700
 You can open your eyes now

26
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,370
 How about that?

27
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,500
 Did you just put on a base makeup

28
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,320
 It's a completely different look

29
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,919
 It's a strange feeling?

30
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:16,320
 So now it's time to start the eye makeup

31
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,800
 Let's use this light pink eyeshadow

32
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,100
 (Note: the heroine doesn't use honorifics after this sentence)

33
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,520
 because you're supposed to look like a girl

34
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,370
 so with a little bit of makeup

35
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,720
 and you'll look cute

36
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,320
 Well, that feels good

37
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:48,800
 It's nice to look good with makeup, isn't it?

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,820
 Next up is... this

39
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,270
This is called an eyelash curler

40
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,820
 Use this to curl your eyelashes

41
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,070
 and your eyes will look big

42
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,300
 Well, that's pretty much it

43
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,600
 So then with the eyeliner

44
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,920
 with a little bit of emphasis on the eyeliner

45
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,720
 and don't move it around

46
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:57,360
 Yeah, there's a lot more

47
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,840
 Eye makeup can change a person's impression to a great extent

48
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,440
 You have to do it properly

49
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,480
 What's wrong?

50
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,720
 because my face is too close to yours

51
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,320
 So it's starting to get tense?

52
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,470
 Did your heart start to beat faster?

53
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,170
 I'm going to do lots and lots of h things to you next

54
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:34,900
 So relax now

55
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,670
 That's nice

56
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,550
 because you have very angular eyes

57
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,450
 we do a slight drooping eyeliner at the corner of the eye

58
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,270
 Let's make it even cuter

59
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,820
 Oops~

60
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,470
 And the other side too...

61
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,500
 Well, that's cute

62
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,670
 Next, brush your lashes slightly with mascara

63
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,200
 Ugh?

64
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,070
 You say I look happy?

65
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:39,320
 Because ~ you're getting cuter and cuter, so my emotions are getting high too

66
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,770
 Your eyes are getting really cute

67
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,500
 And then a little bit of eyebrow pencil

68
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,720
 Ugh? What's going on?

69
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,120
 Yeah, makeup is really hard

70
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:11,420
 But it's nice to make people cuter and cuter like this

71
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,920
 Well, it's perfect!

72
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,820
 Your eyes are so cute

73
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,970
 So next is blush

74
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,700
 What are you shy about?

75
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,720
 It's okay, it's perfect for you

76
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,970
 You look very shy

77
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,800
 You look like a girl too

78
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,320
 Aren't you getting into it a little bit too?

79
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,170
 That's fine

80
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:45,820
 Let's get even cuter

81
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:51,870
 Which lipstick do you use?

82
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,820
 Let's use this one with a slight orange tint

83
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:09,400
 It feels great

84
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,750
 And finally, let's put on the wig

85
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,970
 I think you're more suited to long hair

86
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:22,050
 Here, turn your head a little bit towards me

87
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:29,700
 Oops...

88
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,620
 Well, it's really cute

89
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,070
 Nah, do you want to see it?

90
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,470
 Look at yourself in the mirror

91
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,400
 How does it look?

92
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,700
 Doesn't it feel like you?

93
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:58,370
 You're the cute girl in the mirror

94
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,670
 How's that? Are you happy?

95
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:07,350
 Isn't that a bit strange?

96
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,900
 So let's get dressed

97
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,350
 First of all... start with the underwear

98
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,470
 Is that par for the course

99
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,950
 Wouldn't you rather?

100
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:26,420
 Not unwillingly?

101
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,320
 You wear this next set of underwear

102
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,050
 And this camisole

103
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,870
 What's wrong with you?

104
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,550
 Are you shy about being looked at by me?

105
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:43,500
 In that case, you can use the fitting room here

106
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,300
 Let me see it when you're done

107
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,520
 Can you put on a bra properly by yourself?

108
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,020
 How about that? Is it over?

109
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,670
 Can I open it?

110
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,250
 Ah, it's really ~ lovely

111
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,650
 It really suits you

112
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,950
 Are you happy?

113
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,500
 Nah, are you happy?

114
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,250
 What kind of clothes do you want to wear?

115
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,870
 I've got everything

116
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,370
 Do you want a student uniform?

117
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:02,100
 Do you want a suit-style student uniform or a sailor uniform?

118
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,700
 Suit style?

119
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,850
 Hold on a second

120
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,250
 Suit uniforms...suit uniforms...

121
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,000
 Okay, put it on

122
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,370
 Are you happy you can wear the uniform?

123
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,470
 It suits you!

124
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,850
 It really looks like a girl

125
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,120
 And it doesn't look out of place on the street

126
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,670
 Ahh, it's really cute!

127
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,570
 A little more perfume

128
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,550
 How about that?

129
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:30,100
 Now your body is smelling sweet and fragrant

130
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,200
 That's right...

131
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,770
 Let's come up with a name

132
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,120
 since it's gotten so cute

133
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,050
 We have to come up with a name

134
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,400
 What kind of name do you want?

135
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,870
 Can I help you with that?

136
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:52,320
 Hmmm ~ Tele...

137
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,470
 Can I call you Xiao Yao?

138
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:01,470
 I'm happy that you like that name

139
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,470
 So, we're going out next

140
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,770
 You put on these shoes

141
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:14,650
 Just think about it there's only the living room dressing room and the fitting room

142
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:19,000
 There are other places to go if you want to start conditioning

143
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,150
 Let's go for a walk together

144
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:27,400
 Do you feel shy about going out like this?

145
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,370
 Absolutely no one will notice, don't worry!

146
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,350
 Okay?

147
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:38,320
 Let's hold hands and go out for a walk
