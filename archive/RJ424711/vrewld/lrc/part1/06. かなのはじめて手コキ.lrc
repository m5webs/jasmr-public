[00:06.57]Yes, ear cleaning
[00:14.50]It is very basic to use
[00:22.98]I won't put it in a fluffy book, so don't be afraid
[00:33.73]stay still
[00:52.49]please
[00:56.64]Tickling is not only the sound of MR, but also the feeling,
[01:10.37]so I think it's the same.
[01:25.02]Tomatoes seem
[01:29.88]to go
[01:34.77]up a little better.
[01:40.58]My role is to make sounds that make the audience feel that way.
[01:52.47]Please tell me if it's not enough
[02:07.38]You get used to the sound of smr quite a bit,
[02:13.71]so the same person tends to make the same sound.
[02:19.97]Thankfully the customer is also an outer wall
[02:28.73]I think I've probably gotten used to it by now
[02:38.54]It's too early to say that I'm going to have a man's treatment
[02:49.45]Isn't that
[02:51.23]sad, so how
[02:55.78]do you
[03:00.51]feel?
[03:18.40]painter

[04:27.51]Ume Katsuma
[04:56.24]Only our customers know how much we've grown
[05:00.48]since we started.
[05:06.21]If you have customers, you can't trust them.
[05:12.07]It's not a return,
[05:20.99]but I want
[05:25.98]the customer
[05:30.70]to be more
[05:35.10]happy, so what is it?
[05:47.33]Afterwards, is there anything that feels good?

[09:05.25]doing?
[09:10.14]what time
[09:14.22]do you leave
[09:16.86]The customer who is
[09:21.76]so disgusting
[09:26.69]has a strange voice
[09:31.90]I've been asked a lot, so it's impossible.
[09:42.37]I can't help it
[09:49.88]i am the voice of the customer
[09:54.20]Do you want to hear more?
[10:02.11]You are making the customer feel comfortable, right?
[10:09.21]Let's teach again with the best thing
[10:13.15]even if there is a satellite
[10:29.82]what about
[10:34.66]this

[11:41.98]I think
[11:46.89]the kitten
[11:51.54]looks like
[11:56.29]it's in pain.
[12:03.12]I love animals so please take it out
[12:09.22]what or more
[12:28.40]The customer took off
[12:33.05]his pants
[12:44.80]this
[13:01.92]Um
[13:11.74]do you pee and pee
[13:47.10]world
[13:51.94]After all
[14:01.92]is not it
[14:03.46]It's a customer who will be like this
[14:17.91]Let's have sex in a place like this
[14:32.87]It's okay
[14:34.84]because I'm
[14:39.51]the only one
[14:45.45]If I keep it a secret, the customer won't get caught, right?
[15:01.10]I'm surprised
[15:09.44]please don't
[15:26.43]Thank you
[15:58.53]what's wrong
[16:03.42]with you
[16:19.52]Customer has this
[16:24.22]child stone
[16:28.92]Ochinchin is a different
[16:33.31]creature
[16:43.99]Hello Ochinchin-san
[16:48.86]I replied.
[16:53.66]It's raining today.
[16:58.19]Nice to meet you.
[16:59.46]I'm sorry why are you so big
[17:11.65]If voices come in and it's like that, I won't be able to wear Japan
[17:20.26]I'm in trouble
[17:27.01]I wonder if
[17:31.94]it will be smaller
[17:34.34]if I do
[17:39.14]it, is it refreshing?
[17:43.20]Are you pooping clearly?
[17:51.88]I wonder if I should take out my naked cock and feel refreshed
[18:03.11]what the fuck
[18:10.85]Accumulating female shocker
[18:19.49]It's so puffy
[18:26.97]because it's accumulated in the penis
[18:31.40]But how do you clean
[18:40.13]very nickel
[18:45.06]can i touch
[18:50.02]you
[18:55.81]I thought that maybe he was a child
[19:01.34]who had a lot of trouble with earthquake resistance.
[19:09.87]can i
[19:14.63]touch you?
[19:18.33]i have
[19:23.03]a chance
[19:25.82]I will make the customer's penis clean
[19:35.08]fishing knowledge
[19:56.96]It's all about
[20:01.46]nothing, so I'm calm
[20:05.54]I'm surprised,
[20:12.87]so I can't suddenly
[20:17.86]go wild
[20:29.38]I feel like that
[20:32.10]It seems like you're saying that you want me to love you
[20:43.86]I understand this, I'll try
[21:01.76]It feels good
[21:04.58]to hear
[21:09.04]the same
[21:13.75]voice as before
[21:18.28]Can you feel refreshed
[21:22.98]when you feel good?
[21:31.49]I understand
[21:36.45]That sounds easy
[21:41.71]Because all you have to do is listen to the customer's face and voice.
[21:50.82]Also, you should ask Ochinchin-san.
[21:59.39]person who can reply
[22:01.89]You will reply faster than the customer.
[22:13.40]She's a cute
[22:17.93]girl
[22:34.92]It's a child
[22:39.24]with a lot of
[22:43.73]emotional expressions
[22:47.62]I think we can get along well
[22:54.37]sorry for that face
[22:58.50]Customers were also emotionally expressive.
[23:13.15]It's been a long time since
[23:17.54]I've been in the middle of a long time
[23:21.76]do you feel good do you feel good
[23:29.44]A customer
[23:33.89]who is happy
[23:38.30]to have that done.
[23:42.82]I like
[23:44.72]being pampered.
[23:50.91]What a cute customer
[24:00.64]good friend
[24:10.02]What is
[24:13.55]Koyoshi
[24:17.15]this is something
[24:21.89]you can touch
[24:34.08]how did you
[24:38.88]spread it
[24:51.18]quickly
[24:59.79]do you expect it soon
[25:03.70]I'm happy to hear that.
[25:15.78]Leave it to your sister and wait
[25:23.84]I got
[25:28.30]a slimy ticket
[25:33.02]and got slimy
[25:46.62]yeah yeah i can't wait
[25:52.19]It's no good to go
[26:07.09]If other people saw me, it would have seemed like I was a pervert.
[26:21.12]I can't hear
[26:25.98]your little voice
[26:49.02]can you
[26:53.28]hear me
[27:07.33]Was good
[27:18.10]I understand it
[27:23.09]somehow
[27:44.68]There was also
[27:49.28]a throbbing
[27:54.27]voice
[27:56.61]It's strange that my voice is louder than before, this feels good
[28:11.19]Curry tired
[28:16.10]of OK
[28:24.00]really a customer
[28:35.68]maybe i've heard of this guy
[28:48.95]The sound I heard from the room when Chika-chan was serving customers the other day
[28:58.30]It was the sound of squeezing when I fell asleep with something
[29:07.07]so hard and sticky.
[29:15.76]Come to think of it, the voice that was leaking from the room
[29:27.89]was throbbing like a customer.
[29:33.82]Kika-chan has grown up
[29:40.30]I made
[29:45.06]your penis
[29:49.37]smaller
[29:57.03]But today is a secret to Chika-chan
[30:04.27]wise man who
[30:08.10]can share my
[30:12.89]many secrets

[30:39.39]been able to tell you
[30:44.32]what he wants you to do
[31:08.38]What happened
[31:12.77]to Tsubasa

[32:34.52]It feels good
[32:46.29]I'm happy
[32:55.14]It's not good for customers
[32:59.78]to speak loudly
[33:01.86]hold on a little longer
[33:09.43]let's speak
[33:14.35]out
[33:23.78]it was really funny
[33:29.15]number of customers
[33:40.98]I'm going to repeat my waist and try to get to the point where it feels good

[37:19.68]want you
[37:24.51]to stop
[37:29.31]the dispenser
