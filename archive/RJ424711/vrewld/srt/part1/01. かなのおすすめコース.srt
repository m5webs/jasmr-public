1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,490
one day

2
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,060
started

3
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,640
I'm in charge today.

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,460
Thank you.

5
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,070
That customer, this shop

6
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:52,060
Have you been here several times? Is it just one point?

7
00:00:52,060 --> 00:01:00,800
I'm still about two weeks old

8
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:11,300
The training is finally over and the customer is my first customer.

9
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,210
It's the first time we're together

10
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:20,240
I'm sorry that

11
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,140
you came all the way here.

12
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:38,110
you can do it don't worry

13
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:47,370
Well then, let me start with an explanation.

14
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:56,390
You chose the course recommendation

15
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,290
Okay, my recommendation

16
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,550
is faster,

17
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,440
isn't it?

18
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:25,360
Then let's start

19
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,180
What should I do

20
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:40,900
Let's start with the easy stuff first

21
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:50,110
It's a nail topping

22
00:02:50,110 --> 00:03:00,410
It's all about the sound, but this is surprisingly good

23
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,140
i might be the best

24
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,660
then let's start

25
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:14,360
To go

26
00:03:16,170 --> 00:05:21,420
I'll try it

27
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,810
separately

28
00:05:28,450 --> 00:08:01,560
it's over

29
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,620
how was it

30
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,690
next time

31
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:25,970
Um, next

32
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,860
is sand.

33
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:38,440
It's Oiso sand

34
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,730
This is really a child's toy

35
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:50,620
Do you know that this is sand that you can play with

36
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,170
even in your room?

37
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:01,950
That's right, let's have fun with him

38
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,760
free

39
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,210
tightly

40
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:25,200
It's very much like

41
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,540
dividing the soil of a cat.

42
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,640
is that ok

43
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,900
yes

44
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,840
After all, it feels like

45
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:46,250
Who would have thought to cut

46
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:51,070
my father

47
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,500
I'm relieved

48
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,130
yes suriyan

49
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,520
It feels like

50
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:25,100
Well then, let's do it one more time.

51
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,030
It's amazing that it doesn't come with

52
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:37,670
You can make soil in your room

53
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,440
surprisingly fun

54
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,960
Then I'll do it again

55
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,800
with the left side

56
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,780
next time.

57
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,000
Slowly, slowly,

58
00:13:03,000 --> 00:15:00,320
it's over

59
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:13,820
I don't

60
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,710
have many chances

61
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,510
to ask how it was

62
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:32,100
It's a sound that can't even be called nostalgic, but I'd be happy if you liked it

63
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:38,500
I'll do something new then

64
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,380
This time too, it's the one that's over

65
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:57,840
then what do you think

66
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,070
you don't know

67
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:10,020
This is a melamine sponge impregnated with slime.

68
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,070
It feels like a monkey

69
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:23,880
I thought that too, but you thought about it.

70
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,950
There are many strange things in the world

71
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:40,150
It's expensive, so Zaku goes in.

72
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:46,620
It feels like sand

73
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,480
It sounds different

74
00:16:49,480 --> 00:17:00,990
It's a mix of rough sounds and spicy food sounds.

75
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:07,640
I don't understand

76
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:22,990
It's a Toyo knife,

77
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,460
so it's not dangerous,

78
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,670
but please stay still.

79
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:42,180
yeah i'm going

80
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,510
because it's painful

81
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:18,230
I don't think I hear it

82
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,770
very often

83
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:34,560
But that sort of thing is surprisingly popular.

84
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,430
I actually

85
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,110
should i

86
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:59,090
cut here

87
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:19,620
always go there

88
00:20:22,250 --> 00:21:38,710
up to

89
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,830
the array

90
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:23,370
Shall we start with the opposite

91
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,640
left ear

92
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,370
I will

93
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,620
be surprised

94
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:53,300
hey

95
00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:06,630
It's fun to cut raw silk sponge It's hard to cut

96
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:15,750
I have a strange feeling like I'm cutting spicy food, I wonder what it is

97
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,260
I wonder if it's fun

98
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:31,420
I didn't say anything strange, but it has nothing to do with the customer,

99
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,090
so please don't worry about it.

100
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:37,980
I have to say

101
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,710
it myself

102
00:24:39,710 --> 00:25:20,650
Ah Mi-chan goes there

103
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,840
often too

104
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,100
See you soon

105
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,990
three

106
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:35,720
yes

107
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:40,780
it's over

108
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,700
how was it

109
00:27:50,700 --> 00:28:00,180
Crunchy sponge somehow relaxed

110
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm glad I did it I'm glad

111
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,890
Huh, maybe I've loosened up

112
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:13,930
a bit too

113
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:23,860
Customers are friendly, so you can rest assured

114
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,640
Today was really good for the first time

115
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:35,460
Yes, I'll clean up far away for now

116
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:08,070
i'm not mom

117
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:13,040
what happened

118
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,710
Are you

119
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:22,440
suddenly tired

120
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,350
every day?

121
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:28,060
I have one more

122
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,490
Please relax a little more

123
00:29:32,490 --> 00:30:13,100
Next is the end.

124
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:18,000
Finally, listen to the sound

125
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,290
of the river.

126
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:26,260
Please listen slowly

127
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,400
yes

128
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,460
Sorry I made you wait

129
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,790
Let's do it then

130
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:53,260
today

131
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:03,110
oh the other side

132
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:08,070
too

133
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:37,260
Are you healed by the song of the bubble?

134
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:51,010
customer is vacant

135
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:01,160
correct

136
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:07,990
What's wrong

137
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,800
please don't

138
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,630
lie

139
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:34,730
is it nothing

140
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:39,370
I will continue

141
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:43,170
for a while

142
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:47,960
no

143
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:14,150
customer

144
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:18,600
I can hear you properly

145
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,180
I'm happy

146
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:28,010
It makes me happy to have my husband enjoy a lot,

147
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:38,890
but I guess it's a blessing

148
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:43,720
It's not that big of a deal

149
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,530
It's big, so

150
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:16,300
I put a lid on it.

151
00:39:16,300 --> 00:40:02,670
This is the end of the recommendation

152
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:07,380
for the kettle.

153
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,700
thank you for your hard work

154
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:29,860
How was it?

155
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:39,400
I'm sure you were able to hear it

156
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,030
with a very fresh feeling.

157
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:50,950
i had a lot of

158
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:55,370
fun too

159
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:59,730
I was your first customer.

160
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:04,880
It's very easy to do,

161
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,710
and it's

162
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:13,990
a little regrettable.

163
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:30,120
can you come again

164
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,510
please

165
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:40,300
With this, the first condolence telegram was completed.

166
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,820
Ah, but I don't have to be the only one

167
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:47,110
Mie or nothing

168
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:53,550
Not everyone does the same thing in that treatment,

169
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,800
everyone programs different sounds.

170
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,480
So try to nominate like this

171
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:08,650
It seems that finding the sound you like is one way to enjoy it.

172
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:16,960
I want the audience to enjoy the sound purely.

173
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:25,290
So why don't you show another child next time you come?

174
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:31,690
try it

175
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:42,700
I wonder if this is a good place to recommend

176
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:49,220
There's a girl who's been really popular lately, and she's called Ai-chan.

177
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:54,610
She came into the store a little earlier than me.

178
00:42:54,610 --> 00:43:00,520
I heard that she has a lot of repeats and she's a really cute girl

179
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:07,070
He's also a really good boy

180
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:20,690
with a great personality.

181
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:23,650
I'm getting along well with you

182
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:31,560
Tell me about various things, such as the store.

183
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:38,350
oh try to nominate

184
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:44,580
I've had them do it too, and the sounds were all good.

185
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:52,130
There are many things that are quite stimulating, but I like it.

186
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:58,560
It may be your favorite sound.

187
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:05,860
yes i am waiting

188
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:16,620
What do you think about Kama's efforts today?

189
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:26,320
Thank you for your hard work
