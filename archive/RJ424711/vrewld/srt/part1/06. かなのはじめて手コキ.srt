1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:14,500
Yes, ear cleaning

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:22,980
It is very basic to use

3
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:33,730
I won't put it in a fluffy book, so don't be afraid

4
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,590
stay still

5
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,640
please

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:10,370
Tickling is not only the sound of MR, but also the feeling,

7
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:25,020
so I think it's the same.

8
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,880
Tomatoes seem

9
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,770
to go

10
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,620
up a little better.

11
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:52,470
My role is to make sounds that make the audience feel that way.

12
00:01:52,470 --> 00:02:07,380
Please tell me if it's not enough

13
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,710
You get used to the sound of smr quite a bit,

14
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,970
so the same person tends to make the same sound.

15
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:28,730
Thankfully the customer is also an outer wall

16
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:38,540
I think I've probably gotten used to it by now

17
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:49,450
It's too early to say that I'm going to have a man's treatment

18
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,230
Isn't that

19
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,780
sad, so how

20
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,510
do you

21
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,860
feel?

22
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,100
painter

23
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,100
I understand again.

24
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,830
I promised you.

25
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:49,370
let's continue

26
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:08,090
even if i buy

27
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,220
good reaction

28
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:27,510
hey

29
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:36,510
Ume Katsuma

30
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,480
Only our customers know how much we've grown

31
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,210
since we started.

32
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:12,070
If you have customers, you can't trust them.

33
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:20,990
It's not a return,

34
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,980
but I want

35
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:30,700
the customer

36
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,100
to be more

37
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,700
happy, so what is it?

38
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:58,430
Afterwards, is there anything that feels good?

39
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:07,870
please tell me where

40
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:21,920
Is it a game then let's play a game

41
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,260
Please let me know if I am correct

42
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,460
really

43
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:48,000
from Karin Karin

44
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:18,110
mushroom party

45
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:29,860
is it correct so far

46
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:42,160
Cocco sure told me

47
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,590
so heart

48
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,840
This Cocco Nipple

49
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,830
Sucking Woman

50
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:16,670
Maybe the customer's

51
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:23,040
nipples are comfortable, isn't it?

52
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:36,350
Feeling good nipples Feeling good,

53
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:40,900
so I'm making such a voice

54
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,140
is

55
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,100
I'm getting tough

56
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,370
as a man

57
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,250
How are you

58
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:10,140
doing?

59
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,220
what time

60
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,860
do you leave

61
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,760
The customer who is

62
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,690
so disgusting

63
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:31,900
has a strange voice

64
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:42,370
I've been asked a lot, so it's impossible.

65
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:49,880
I can't help it

66
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,200
i am the voice of the customer

67
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:02,110
Do you want to hear more?

68
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:09,210
You are making the customer feel comfortable, right?

69
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,150
Let's teach again with the best thing

70
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,820
even if there is a satellite

71
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,660
what about

72
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:41,020
this

73
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,770
A strong feeling

74
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:49,620
that beats ping

75
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,430
ping ton

76
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,580
Feeling good, feeling

77
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,750
good

78
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,300
my bones

79
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,810
are swollen

80
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:34,420
who brought

81
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,170
the animal

82
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,890
I think

83
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,540
the kitten

84
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,290
looks like

85
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,160
it's in pain.

86
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,220
I love animals so please take it out

87
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,820
what or more

88
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,050
The customer took off

89
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,580
his pants

90
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,240
this

91
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,850
Um

92
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:24,380
do you pee and pee

93
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,940
world

94
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,040
After all

95
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,460
is not it

96
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:17,910
It's a customer who will be like this

97
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:24,770
Let's have sex in a place like this

98
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,840
It's okay

99
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,510
because I'm

100
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:45,450
the only one

101
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:56,100
If I keep it a secret, the customer won't get caught, right?

102
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,660
I'm surprised

103
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,800
please don't

104
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:31,190
Thank you

105
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:03,420
what's wrong

106
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,530
with you

107
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,220
Customer has this

108
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,920
child stone

109
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,310
Ochinchin is a different

110
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:37,590
creature

111
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:48,860
Hello Ochinchin-san

112
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:53,660
I replied.

113
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,190
It's raining today.

114
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,460
Nice to meet you.

115
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:11,650
I'm sorry why are you so big

116
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:20,260
If voices come in and it's like that, I won't be able to wear Japan

117
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,630
I'm in trouble

118
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:31,940
I wonder if

119
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,340
it will be smaller

120
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,140
if I do

121
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,200
it, is it refreshing?

122
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:51,880
Are you pooping clearly?

123
00:17:51,880 --> 00:18:03,110
I wonder if I should take out my naked cock and feel refreshed

124
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:07,840
what the fuck

125
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,720
Accumulating female shocker

126
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:26,970
It's so puffy

127
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:31,400
because it's accumulated in the penis

128
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:40,130
But how do you clean

129
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:45,060
very nickel

130
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:50,020
can i touch

131
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:54,650
you

132
00:18:55,810 --> 00:19:01,340
I thought that maybe he was a child

133
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:09,870
who had a lot of trouble with earthquake resistance.

134
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,630
can i

135
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,330
touch you?

136
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:23,030
i have

137
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,820
a chance

138
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:35,080
I will make the customer's penis clean

139
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,680
fishing knowledge

140
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,460
It's all about

141
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,540
nothing, so I'm calm

142
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:12,870
I'm surprised,

143
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:17,860
so I can't suddenly

144
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:22,620
go wild

145
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,100
I feel like that

146
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:43,860
It seems like you're saying that you want me to love you

147
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:49,070
I understand this, I'll try

148
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,580
It feels good

149
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:09,040
to hear

150
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,750
the same

151
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,280
voice as before

152
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,980
Can you feel refreshed

153
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,580
when you feel good?

154
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:36,450
I understand

155
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:41,710
That sounds easy

156
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:50,820
Because all you have to do is listen to the customer's face and voice.

157
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:59,390
Also, you should ask Ochinchin-san.

158
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,890
person who can reply

159
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:13,400
You will reply faster than the customer.

160
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,930
She's a cute

161
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:22,590
girl

162
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,240
It's a child

163
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,730
with a lot of

164
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,620
emotional expressions

165
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:54,370
I think we can get along well

166
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:58,500
sorry for that face

167
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,440
Customers were also emotionally expressive.

168
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:17,540
It's been a long time since

169
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,760
I've been in the middle of a long time

170
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:29,440
do you feel good do you feel good

171
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,890
A customer

172
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:38,300
who is happy

173
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,820
to have that done.

174
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,720
I like

175
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,910
being pampered.

176
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:55,710
What a cute customer

177
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,060
good friend

178
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,550
What is

179
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:17,150
Koyoshi

180
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:21,890
this is something

181
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,990
you can touch

182
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,880
how did you

183
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,810
spread it

184
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,870
quickly

185
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:03,700
do you expect it soon

186
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:15,780
I'm happy to hear that.

187
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:23,840
Leave it to your sister and wait

188
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,300
I got

189
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:33,020
a slimy ticket

190
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,660
and got slimy

191
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:52,190
yeah yeah i can't wait

192
00:25:52,190 --> 00:26:07,090
It's no good to go

193
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:16,680
If other people saw me, it would have seemed like I was a pervert.

194
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,980
I can't hear

195
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,720
your little voice

196
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:53,280
can you

197
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:58,200
hear me

198
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:11,710
Was good

199
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:23,090
I understand it

200
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:27,620
somehow

201
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,280
There was also

202
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:54,270
a throbbing

203
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,610
voice

204
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:11,190
It's strange that my voice is louder than before, this feels good

205
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:16,100
Curry tired

206
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,060
of OK

207
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,660
really a customer

208
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:48,950
maybe i've heard of this guy

209
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:58,300
The sound I heard from the room when Chika-chan was serving customers the other day

210
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:07,070
It was the sound of squeezing when I fell asleep with something

211
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:15,760
so hard and sticky.

212
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:27,890
Come to think of it, the voice that was leaking from the room

213
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:33,820
was throbbing like a customer.

214
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:40,300
Kika-chan has grown up

215
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:45,060
I made

216
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:49,370
your penis

217
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:54,080
smaller

218
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:04,270
But today is a secret to Chika-chan

219
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:08,100
wise man who

220
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,890
can share my

221
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:17,790
many secrets

222
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:27,040
send it to

223
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,750
the man

224
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:39,390
Kirby hasn't

225
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:44,320
been able to tell you

226
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,660
what he wants you to do

227
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,770
What happened

228
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:17,570
to Tsubasa

229
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,140
If not, you can

230
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:32,770
pamper me

231
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:37,310
Can I tell you

232
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:42,220
that I love you Crayon

233
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,350
Shin-chan

234
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:10,330
I love you when you stand with yesterday

235
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:19,330
I haven't healed yet I can't speak

236
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:24,190
how do you

237
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:24,750
like me today

238
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:34,520
Is that so

239
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,300
It feels good

240
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:50,830
I'm happy

241
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,780
It's not good for customers

242
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,860
to speak loudly

243
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,290
hold on a little longer

244
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:14,350
let's speak

245
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:19,200
out

246
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:29,150
it was really funny

247
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:40,980
number of customers

248
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:54,780
I'm going to repeat my waist and try to get to the point where it feels good

249
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:59,370
I hate it more and more

250
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,880
I can't take

251
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,330
an inflated photo

252
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,340
isn't it

253
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:19,340
I've said

254
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:24,030
it many times

255
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:34,400
it's cold

256
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:43,680
I can't stand

257
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:48,670
it

258
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:59,860
customer

259
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,350
seem to be

260
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:15,410
unhappy with

261
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,290
it hurts

262
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:33,310
are you okay

263
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:47,940
didn't you go

264
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:58,190
what happened i want you to stop

265
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:03,040
Too early

266
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,070
Stop it,

267
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:19,680
because I don't

268
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,510
want you

269
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:29,310
to stop

270
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:34,190
the dispenser

271
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:49,580
I'm on the side of a good boy's penis,

272
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:59,680
so I won't say it clearly

273
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,190
Kamen Rider Kamen Rider

274
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,790
It's nice

275
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:14,690
to hear that

276
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,220
you're so happy

277
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:21,180
to find

278
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:25,870
this song

279
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:43,300
Please tell me everything you want me to see

280
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:51,930
The customer will still drive to the end

281
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:55,980
so go ahead

282
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,970
go

283
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:16,920
I don't know

284
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,060
different guy

285
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,350
This was piling

286
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:48,750
up

287
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,690
I made

288
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:58,730
the calendar

289
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:03,590
hard, but the picnic has

290
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:07,870
healed

291
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:24,240
it was raining

292
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:39,220
a lot

293
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,830
It was refreshing

294
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:53,410
Ah, is that so?

295
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:58,250
It was good

296
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:09,950
Is this going to be an Ochinchin cafe?

297
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:22,330
I feel like I did

298
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:25,670
something amazing
