1
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:16,640
ok ok france

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,800
hello hello customers

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,330
Onii-san today is Ai and Kana-chan's double

4
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,890
thank you

5
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:45,730
Thank you

6
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:55,400
Um, the two of us were just talking about what we should do.

7
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,580
Yeah, I've done double pages many times,

8
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,210
so I thought I'd try something a little different.

9
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:12,710
Kana-chan, the older brother who Ai-chan blamed for love

10
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:18,250
My older brother wants to do something that pleases me, so I'll lick his ears

11
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,510
I'm not going

12
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:30,560
that far

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:39,270
Onii-san, something good will surely happen after this is over

14
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:54,210
Prepare properly and nothing will happen.

15
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:08,960
I knew I should start with ham ham

16
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,510
I will go

17
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,400
yes

18
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,080
I see

19
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,630
yes

20
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,840
yes

21
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,530
yes

22
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,510
yes

23
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:55,440
For real

24
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:23,430
yes sisters next

25
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,120
Umm, the guy

26
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,270
who will support you

27
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,900
in your ear

28
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,570
during terrorism, huh?

29
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,700
did the point

30
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,990
Well then, will you heal the guy

31
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,660
who will hold the tip of the next terrorist

32
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,710
attack at Fuji?

33
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,730
yes

34
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,460
I was holding

35
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:27,010
of

36
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,620
click it

37
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,750
yeah yeah

38
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,930
yes yes

39
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,500
And this

40
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:43,150
yes yes

41
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,800
yes

42
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:06,040
It was

43
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,790
the ear spot

44
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:22,160
Next time, I'll crush my reactions like anxiety

45
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:30,910
I'll get closer and do it with a round eye

46
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,690
Even if it tickles me,

47
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,560
I'll endure it, yes

48
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,530
Oh, yes

49
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,540
yes

50
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,310
It was dog

51
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:15,080
play

52
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:28,050
Next time I'll do that Kokubun in my ears

53
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:41,540
Yeah, yeah, he's the guy who buys clothes

54
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:45,730
all the way in.

55
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,620
yes

56
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,790
yes

57
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:33,480
it was deep

58
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:46,810
Well then, next time,

59
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:51,610
you'll really understand

60
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,540
the features of Torinami-ageru

61
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,900
and the lower ototsu

62
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,290
at the entrance of the ear.

63
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,380
to go

64
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,370
yes

65
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,250
Rough

66
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:49,600
Oh yeah, the next one is the last

67
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:58,370
Stop it once more

68
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:03,070
my ears get soggy

69
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:07,900
reduce

70
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:28,110
I don't think so

71
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,340
Is that so

72
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:05,230
Yes Yes

73
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:13,360
yeah yeah yeah

74
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,670
it's over

75
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:51,650
lonesome cleaning

76
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,910
devoted

77
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,430
It's okay to blow away like this

78
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:06,300
Takayuki

79
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,750
don't wait

80
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,970
Kana-chan and Hihara

81
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,860
big brother

82
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:33,660
Nekana-chan really got

83
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:38,180
big again

84
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,750
what should i do in this situation

85
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:55,820
Kana-chan, who doesn't really know what to do,

86
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:05,670
has already seen her brother's father.

87
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:16,580
You don't have to be complicated, and I'll stand up for you, so let's be together

88
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,150
Anything called money

89
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:25,370
is salt if you do it
