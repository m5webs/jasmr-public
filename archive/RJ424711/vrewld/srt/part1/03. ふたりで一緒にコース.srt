00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:22,540
Hello from Nii-san today

2
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:32,900
Thank you for the double nominations today Thank you

3
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:40,500
Chika-chan, you're really showing me

4
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,840
I told you once before I met you

5
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:54,220
That's why I was so happy

6
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,650
When the customer's name was called, Chika-chan went,

7
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:03,040
but she wasn't happy.

8
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:16,510
Well, it's okay Karakana-chan, first of all, it's a greeting.

9
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,870
I'm rather nervous.

10
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,070
thank you

11
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,630
I will be in charge today

12
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:35,450
After that, it's a deer. Today we'll do it together.

13
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,940
Kana-chan, it's the first time I've been with someone

14
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:47,000
Let your grown-up brother take the lead

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,120
let's start gently

16
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,580
I will go next

17
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:00,380
to you

18
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:16,210
I get nervous when there are other people

19
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:22,310
I'm sure your brother is with you too

20
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,750
That's right, look at your face

21
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,690
The customer's face is red

22
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:38,300
This is the face

23
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:43,490
of a trained adult

24
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,480
I want you to hurry up,

25
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,020
hurry up

26
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,810
Shall I give

27
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,480
lots of challengers

28
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:10,830
Today's side dish is a course

29
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:17,890
for the two of us together, right?

30
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:25,960
There is one for the right ear and the other for the left ear

31
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,470
But we do the same things

32
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:34,530
Because the people are different, the radio waves and the feeling of the sound are also different.

33
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:43,480
It's pretty funny I hope you like it

34
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:53,070
Well, to start with, sukusuku to sukusuku is just like the word,

35
00:03:53,070 --> 00:04:04,680
just sukusuku and whispers.It's surprisingly popular overseas.

36
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,410
I'll do it

37
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:12,780

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,030
Quickly quickly

39
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,350
Quickly quickly

40
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,540
Quickly quickly

41
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,340
Quickly quickly

42
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,520
Quickly quickly

43
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,050
Quickly quickly

44
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:27,050
Round, round, round, round, round, round, round, round, round, round,

45
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:34,540
round, round, round, round, round, round

46
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:40,330
Round, round, round, round, round, round, round, round

47
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:53,880
Like, like, like, like,

48
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:00,300
like, like, like, like, like, like, like

49
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,570
I'll eat

50
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,180
a little more

51
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,660
in September

52
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:26,760
Quickly

53
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,350
Quickly quickly

54
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:35,930
Quickly

55
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:44,260
Quickly

56
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,120
Quickly quickly

57
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,610
Quickly quickly

58
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,720
Quickly quickly

59
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,280
Quickly

60
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,060
Chika Chika

61
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:05,260
Chika-chan is playing a prank,

62
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:11,810
right?

63
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:25,870
Onii-san, it's an important song after March, isn't it?

64
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:40,610
If you don't want to do something you don't like, you'll get there.

65
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,340
I need a little preparation

66
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,260
Chika-chan yes

67
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,250
carbonated water

68
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:02,680
Substitute for carbonated water

69
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,460
and kappa

70
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,530
Thank you

71
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,790
carbonic acid

72
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,250
water is marinade

73
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:01,490
baby

74
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:11,290
I'll put it

75
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,640
in chorochoro

76
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:35,710
I'm ready

77
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:46,540
The sound that calms down like this for a while

78
00:08:46,540 --> 00:09:00,630
It's a crackling crackling intro

79
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,300
Thank you

80
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,200
Rika

81
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,230
Kurume Round

82
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,650
and Round

83
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:00,980
The alternative song was important

84
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,570
Cool Sound Nampa

85
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,710
in memory of grandma

86
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,690
Ama-chan Maki-chan

87
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,960
no Uta Nogizaka

88
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,550
carbonic acid

89
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,570
It's water diamond cider,

90
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,850
but I don't really think of it

91
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:11,420
as a sound.

92
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:18,550
I usually only think about what it tasted like and whether it was delicious or not.

93
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:27,130
In the past, I used to say that I would go to the store to enjoy this kind of sound.

94
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm talking about the Edo period.

95
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,190
It was a time when being too old

96
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,220
was one of the entertainment

97
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,730
A child like this came around

98
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:18,390
Next is September 4th and the same performance as this child

99
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,700
Kana-chan looks tired, no

100
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:04,600
It's getting hard to breathe, these boobs

101
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:55,410
Lucky bag

102
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,800
Ako-chan

103
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,170
I still use cider

104
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:19,480
stay still again

105
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,220
wrinkled

106
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,930
wrinkled

107
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:48,780
cider

108
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:54,240
It's a little different,

109
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,230
it's not

110
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:04,090
a crackling sound,

111
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,560
but a wrinkling sound.

112
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,940
Mokka

113
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,820

114
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,730
say something

115
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:53,750
wrinkled

116
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,410
I wonder if the carbonic

117
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,540
acid is gone soon

118
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,290
It works really well

119
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,250
next and last

120
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:14,330
Lastly, wrap it up sore-chan

121
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:19,280
chika-chan yes

122
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:33,410

00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:49,370
Tapping Tapping Tapping Tapping Tapping

124

125
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,820
Everyone likes it,

126
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,700
the side of the entrance,

127
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,210
the entrance is here,

128
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,450
this house

129
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:25,810
is kind

130
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,300
Kindness

131
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:46,210
Tatter Tatter

132
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,000
Tracing or something

133
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,840
just a little more and more

134
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,540
and more and more and more

135
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,820
even here

136
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,870
Also

137
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:05,290
Chika-chan, Rika-chan,

138
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:10,670
something will come out

139
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:22,610
It's true, but is it big brother auction club?

140
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:34,080
If so, please let me know my friends

141
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,820
what happened to yochika

142
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:47,250
I'll do the same

143
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,190
A customer who stopped by

144
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:59,730
I can't help it

145
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:04,780
because I'm tired

146
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,500
Kana-chan, I'll teach you

147
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,200
how to turn

148
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,350
off your mouth

149
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:31,370
and turn on your ears

150
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:36,890
Don't say it's not that exaggerated

151
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:49,880
It's not a mouth, but it doesn't matter

152
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,450
anime brother

153
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,310
Then park for a while

154
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,740
Chika-chan's dream

155
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:08,210
Why are you my important customer?

156
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:12,600
Don't be weird, it's not weird

157
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,500
It's just because your brother wants you to come

158
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:25,360
Then I'll do it with you, so let's do it together

159
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,260
Good customer

160
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,910
I was loved

161
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:38,130
Then

162
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:46,660
Please tell me

163
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:52,110
if you don't like it

164
00:22:52,110 --> 00:23:04,100
Kana-chan, I'll leave the start to Kana-chan

165
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,460
Do you get it

166
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,400
can you play

167
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:35,450
I'm still going

168
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:56,790
Idol collage

169
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:05,200
it's time

170
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:13,900
I ended up in a place with extended service

171
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:23,430
I wanted to do more calculations, so I can't make it in time

172
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:35,580
Brother Meyer, thank you for your hard work. I will clean up now.

173
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:41,120
I can talk with you just a little more

174
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,230
Welcome to your account

175
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,290
I went

176
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:21,310
Maybe even a joke that was hated is pessimistic

177
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,080
no no no that

178
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,170
what do you mean

179
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:33,690
i mean i was embarrassed

180
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:37,060
I don't know

181
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,130
what kind of face you should make

182
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:43,480
when you're alone with your brother.

183
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,170
Because you're an important customer

184
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:57,370
I didn't want to make you feel strange, so I ran away

185
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:10,140
Big brother Kana-chan isn't getting better, right?

186
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:14,630
I saw your face when you left, even your ears were bright red

187
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,220
Just by looking at your brother,

188
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,940
you acted like you were scared

189
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:28,590
That's right, I know your brother

190
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:35,020
A girl who doesn't understand the meaning of a girl who doesn't understand the heart

191
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,110
I get timid when

192
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:42,390
I'm in front of someone I like

193
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,540
I get scared I don't want to be hated

194
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,580
I'm afraid to meet you outside and run away

195
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:59,980
It's that kind of creature, so it has a bit of a pulse

196
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:06,240
I'm sure it was, brother

197
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:21,190
It's the same as getting a big

198
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:27,620
dick when someone who likes squirt girls is in front of you.

199
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,840
I thought you were divorced

200
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,770
because you didn't react at all

201
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:44,230
Even if it's a Lolita

202
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:50,670
with a touch

203
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:55,280
Wakana-chan, I'm going to visit the front desk while I'm here.

204
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:02,450
I'll decide first

205
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,060
It's okay,

206
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:16,890
Kana-chan is probably interested

207
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:30,260
I see, you don't want to be hated by Kana-chan, even onii-san.

208
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:40,160
I'm scared to meet you dressed like that, can't you help it?

209
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:45,110
Let's get away from each other

210
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:50,100
with strong people

211
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,870
Shall I do it

212
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,330
for you?
