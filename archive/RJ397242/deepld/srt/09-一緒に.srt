09- Snuggle

1
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,150
Woof

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,970
I said, "Woof, get up!

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:17,770
Get up, it's your master's order

4
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,300
Get up

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,500
And so it is ......

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:45,900
Then ......

7
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,190
Good morning

8
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,810
No ...... it's not morning

9
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,700
It's 3:30am

10
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:02,170
In the morning you have to say hello to the whole family

11
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,180
So ...... little woof

12
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:14,230
Let's run away ...... to a faraway place

13
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,730
I won't let Woof be dealt with

14
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:26,569
I've said it before, right? I'm going to make you happy little woof

15
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:34,450
It's the owner's job to take care of the pet to the end

16
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,160
No, it's okay ......

17
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,030
Here you go.

18
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,600
Oh, it's a bank book

19
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,030
The money I got from my New Year's Eve, my pocket money, and my salary from my secret job

20
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,700
That's enough money to live on for a year

21
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,990
I started preparing for it a long time ago

22
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,180
but I never got around to it

23
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:10,160
But you got up the courage to help me, didn't you?

24
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,450
So ...... now it's my turn to help you

25
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,160
And it's okay

26
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,110
For me, now that I've lost my virginity

27
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,230
there's no place in the world for me anymore

28
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:31,510
I've renounced my marriage and been disinherited from my family

29
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,710
I am no longer of any value

30
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,579
This has taken a lot of time

31
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:40,130
a marriage that took so much time and so many hands to make

32
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:46,040
The bride has run away with her pet on the brink of marriage

33
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,380
What will people think?

34
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:54,620
People still think that Aoi, such a good boy who knows how to behave, wouldn't do something like that

35
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:04,050
These people don't know that I've always been a bad boy

36
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,250
I just wanted to be with the person I wanted to be with

37
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:14,450
It's up to me to decide who I'm going to be with

38
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:20,500
Mum and Dad think that a woman's happiness is to be an appendage to a man

39
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,310
In their minds, Aoi is a good boy who knows how to behave

40
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,090
and should understand that

41
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:32,750
They seem to be looking out for me but they never try to understand the real me

42
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,690
So that's all right

43
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:42,420
Woof, I'm going to make you happy too

44
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,810
Even if you can't do anything, even if you don't do anything

45
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:54,130
I'll love you for the rest of my life

46
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:02,330
Little Wang, hold out your hand

47
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:08,630
Hold hands and it won't be cold anymore, right?

48
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:14,330
So we should almost go, right?

49
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,810
Let's stay together too

50
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,810
I love you, Woof
