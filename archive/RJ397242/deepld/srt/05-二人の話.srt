05-Two's a Thing

1
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:12,289
Woof, I've shot so much, my feet are covered in it

2
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:24,239
Stand up and let me untie you

3
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,110
I'm exhausted

4
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:35,460
Tired? Or is there something surprising?

5
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:47,950
Well, Woof, come to bed, it's cold on the floor

6
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:56,770
Hold hands

7
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:03,020
Nah, what just happened

8
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,740
I'm going to get married by my father

9
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,490
I said we'd meet tomorrow, right?

10
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,210
It was a lie to get Woof excited

11
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,890
I wanted to say that

12
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:25,940
but it's true, but liking him is a lie

13
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:32,930
I've only met him a few times, and he's not really my type.

14
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:39,520
as the opposite sex or otherwise, I don't like

15
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,200
and haven't spoken to each other at all

16
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,350
I'm sorry I've kept it from you, I thought I'd tell you someday

17
00:01:48,350 --> 00:02:01,020
Woof, you said you liked me, so it was hard for me to say it

18
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:12,610
Even if I did, it's a foregone conclusion, there's no way out

19
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,500
I think you know that, too, Xiao Wang

20
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:22,260
Most of the males are now hard workers or pleasure pets

21
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,540
Human males are rare

22
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:34,610
So maybe the average girl can't find a mate and get married

23
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:39,220
but my family has a history of working with such traditions

24
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,740
if there's no male child, the family will look for an heir

25
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:50,100
to bring in a son-in-law to keep the family prestigious

26
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,480
It's a custom from the old days, it can't be helped

27
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:03,030
But to marry someone you don't like and to have children

28
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:12,320
I hated it, so I talked to my mum and dad about it a lot

29
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,030
but they didn't agree with me

30
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,690
So, when I saw the leftover woof in the shop

31
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,160
I'm going to buy the little woof as a pet

32
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,540
and I made a deal with them as a condition of agreeing to get married

33
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:38,910
The deal that I made when I bought the woof, as I said before, is one of the two

34
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:44,480
I thought if I chose the outcome myself, I might be able to accept it

35
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:53,740
So now I'm going to do what I have to do for my mum and dad

36
00:03:53,740 --> 00:04:05,370
And it's said that it's an honor to marry a man of the noble class

37
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:24,180
Nah, Woof, can I have a hug, please?

38
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,960
It's so warm

39
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:36,930
Nah, Woof, I

40
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:43,450
I really don't want to

41
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:54,680
I'm actually scared that I don't want to get married

42
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,190
But it's a promise I have to keep

43
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:09,420
The ceremony is already being prepared and it's too late to do anything about it

44
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,230
Well, next week

45
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:20,279
Tomorrow's meeting is to discuss the marriage ceremony in advance for next week

46
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:26,980
If I get married, I'll have to live with him

47
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:34,840
I won't be able to hold Woof like this anymore

48
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:42,790
And there's a rule that says girls with male experience can't get married

49
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:48,520
If they found out, the marriage would be annulled

50
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,900
I'm still a virgin

51
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:58,980
but whether it's to a man of low enough status to be a pet to deal with sexual desires

52
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:07,029
or cuddling like this, it's not really a good idea

53
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:18,450
It's our secret. 

54
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:18,450
Well, thank you.

55
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:32,060
Nah, Woof, finally, you want to see me naked?

56
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:42,420
I can't do it, but if you just want to see it, you can.

57
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:50,300
No? What a gentleman!

58
00:06:50,300 --> 00:07:03,040
Then let's sleep together like this today

59
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:10,700
Yeah, it's okay. We'll just stay in the room for the day.

60
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:28,830
And I'll be too restless to sleep alone

61
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:48,000
Nah, what does Woof think of me?

62
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Like? 

63
00:07:48,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Not as a master, but as a girl

64
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:09,920
 No need to shout, Woof, you can talk, no one will hear you.

65
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,350
 In human language

66
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:32,950
Well, thank you. I like Woof too.

67
00:08:32,950 --> 00:09:52,309
Woof, good night!

68
00:09:52,309 --> 00:10:02,050
Woof is asleep

69
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:15,780
Lovely sleeping face, nah, Woof

70
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,970
I...

71
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:28,110
I want Woof to come and save me

72
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:42,260
We'll go far away together... 

73
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:42,260
Just a delusion...

74
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:51,179
fall asleep

75
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:54,179
I like you best, Woof
