8 The Covenant

1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,920
Ah, welcome home

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,030
Oh, why are you home at this hour?

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,880
Why? Can't you be at home?

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,550
It's not that I can't

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:17,550
That's fine. 

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,430
What, in the middle of the day?

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,550
Well, Sayu has grown up

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,820
No, that's not true

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,470
Oh, that's mean, that's mean, you two have fun

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,310
I'll see him off when we go back

11
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,060
You don't need to see him off either

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,060
I'm talking to my boyfriend... 

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,490
You're rude to say that back

14
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:52,370
Um... sorry

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,120
Why don't you go to your room and make love? 

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,120
I'm sorry

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:04,980
There's no such thing... let's go to the room

18
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,060
Thank you for contacting me early... I missed you

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,960
Enjoy it later, huh?

20
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,960
You two have fun then, I'll get you some tea
