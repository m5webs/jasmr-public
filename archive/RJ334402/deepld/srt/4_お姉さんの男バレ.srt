4 Sister exposes male body

1
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,690
Sayu-sau?

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,030
Uh! What's wrong brother?

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:15,520
Ah, you two are busy... sorry

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,660
Why are you acting like this at home again?

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:19,660
Eh? 

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:26,430
It's more comfortable this way. I can't help it.

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,720
Hello again

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,990
Eh? You two have met before?

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,960
We met in the corridor before, just to say hello

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,650
Oh...

11
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:45,810
Is it okay if I borrow your boyfriend? I'm going to the grocery store, and I need to pick up a conversation on the way or something.

12
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,360
Borrow? He's not an object.

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,360
What does it matter? 

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,360
 What does it matter? 

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,500
 I've done my job, I'm free now, I can hear it.

16
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:01,520
Ugh... you're home... that's bad

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,190
Whatever you want. Are you going?

18
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,880
Then take care on your way

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,240
What? And be careful on the road?

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,110
Literally

21
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:15,110
Well...okay, okay...I'll lend it to me first... 

22
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:22,450
Let's go, boyfriend

23
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:30,390
I'll wait downstairs in the car and come down when I'm done with my clothes

24
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:44,750
You told me that when we met before, that's my brother, not my sister

25
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:53,850
The sister I told you about before was another ordinary person, and that's what she looked like

26
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,830
He's a man of both sexes, so be really careful

27
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:07,350
Well, I think it's okay though

28
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,350
I'll be waiting for you~
