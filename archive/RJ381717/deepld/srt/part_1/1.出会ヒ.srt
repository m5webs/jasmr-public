1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
1. in an abandoned hospital

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,616
You're awake

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,396
It's no use panicking

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,856
You can't escape

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,886
Thy body has become
entangled in the thread

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:36,910
Thou art caught in the
net of my concubine

7
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:43,566
Why hast thou come to this ruin?

8
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,786
Never mind

9
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,316
Thou art the first
prey in half a month

10
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:57,340
And to be loved well

11
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,926
You look just like me

12
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,836
I'm a face person

13
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:30,860
I have to eat anyway, but a
handsome, young man is best

14
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:39,810
I've only had one over
the age of 40 so far

15
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:47,346
So, what should I do?

16
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:52,756
Do you have any more wishes?

17
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,786
To beg forgiveness for a moment?

18
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:04,956
Ha? [01:57.81] Wishing
that I might kill thee?

19
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:12,980
What? [02:04.98] Have you heard rumours
of me and come to pay tribute?

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,146
People are hard to understand

21
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:30,170
But ...... it would be a
pity to kill thee outright

22
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:40,810
It's better to wait for
a taste before killing

23
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:51,676
For the sake of your
initiative to let me eat

24
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:59,700
Before you die, see me
as I was when I was born

25
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:30,370
The spider's legs have sprouted from the limbs,
and this is what I looked like when I was born

26
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:39,180
Well ...... I don't think
you're very scared

27
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:49,446
Why? Why is your face so red?
Thou ......

28
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:57,470
very ...... beautiful?
Dost thou say concubine?

29
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,206
What a bummer ......

30
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:09,230
Tell me, what is thy
trouble Tell me

31
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,696
roar ...... how dare they bully
each other as human beings ......

32
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:31,720
So thou hast become a victim
of thy fellow man ......

33
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:38,436
A single epidemic can kill all those
who are not yet 100 years old

34
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,786
but revel in the pleasure
of bullying your own people

35
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,636
What a fool

36
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,026
But I still don't understand

37
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:59,716
Did you come here because you thought
it would be best if I ate you?

38
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:07,740
Obviously there are many
other ways to die ......

39
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:18,610
Did you come here because
you had a desire for me?

40
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:26,636
Because I'm embarrassed to
court a human female ......

41
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,366
It would be best if I
could have an affair

42
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,906
Even if the worst outcome
is to be eaten by a demon

43
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:41,686
As long as it's a demoness,
it's a good idea, isn't it?

44
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:49,536
So, what? [05:41.71] What?

45
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:56,466
And if I were to do it,
would you not hide from it?

46
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,336
Ha ...... can't laugh ......

47
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,796
No ......

48
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,476
ghosts or whatever it
is it doesn't matter

49
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,796
just the obsession of being
able to have sex with a female

50
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,766
I'm impressed

51
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:21,790
I'm not comfortable being considered
inferior to humans, though

52
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:27,326
but the phrase "what is not done
by one's own kind does not hurt"

53
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,646
I don't understand it either

54
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:38,236
And when thou saw'st me, thou
didst not flee, but lust'dst

55
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:44,446
I am very fond of thee

56
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:51,086
Thou art a strange man, too

57
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:57,786
Thy wishes are not
unfulfilled for thee

58
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:05,810
Then ......

59
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,746
I ask thee once more

60
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:21,770
Do you still want to have intercourse
with me, a demon, when you see this limb?

61
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:35,090
So it is

62
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,186
Does it tickle?

63
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,936
I see

64
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:52,396
Let me make your wish come true

65
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:58,206
Slowly, don't hold me so tight

66
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,756
What a cute little guy

67
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:07,956
I've been dreaming about
the union of my soul

68
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:14,446
Do you want to do it
with me that badly?

69
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:22,470
How old do you think I am?

70
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:28,716
24?

71
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,346
How wrong

72
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,756
I have lived nearly ten
times as long as this

73
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:43,236
Thou hast said before
that I should kill thee

74
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:51,260
And which is stronger, thy desire
for death or thy desire for sex?

75
00:08:52,080 --> 00:09:00,080
Let us ask thee here

76
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:09,190
Oh, to be so good-looking and
to grow something so hideous

77
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,765
Then I'll touch it
